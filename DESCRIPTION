Description: This package was built to construct a user friendly workflow to help
preople inferring new interaction between prey and predator. This workflow is based
on traits and optionnaly phylogeny of prey species to predict these interactions. 
The interation can be Boolean or continous pressure. It can be usefull to predict
interaction of introduced predator species for which we have interaction data 
on the native range but not on the invasive.
